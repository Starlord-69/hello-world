# hello-world

Greetings

I work as a Graphic and Website designer in Australia.
My company is called Temple Design and I'm a sole trader (so I work for myself and determine my own hours - Awesome)
I have about 50 clients now so I am doing well and life is good.

Other than work I love to snowboard, surf, take my dog "Ripley" to the beach or park and let him go crazy and ride my motorbike on some long rides around the south west of Australia.

Peace!
